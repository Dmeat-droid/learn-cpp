# Key Insights
- An object is used to store a value in memory.
- Object that has name (identifier) called variable.
- The data type of an object must be known at compile-time (so the compiler knows how much memory that object requires).

# Objects and Variables
In CPP, direct memory access is discouraged. Instead, we access memory indirectly through an object. An **Object** represents a region of storage that can hold value. 
    Rather than say "go get the value stored in mailbox 3439", we can say, "go get the value stored by this object" and let the compiler figure out where and how to retrieve the value. An object can be unnamed(anonymous). An object with name is called a variable.

# Data types
In CPP, the type of an object must be known at compile-time and cannot be changed without recompiling the program.
