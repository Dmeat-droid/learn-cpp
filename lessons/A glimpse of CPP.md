# A glimpse of CPP

C and C++ can be summed as "trust the programmer" because **it designed to allow the programmer a high degree of freedom** to do what they want. It can be dangerous and useful at once. It also meant that it won't stop you doing things that don't make sense.



C++ is good at such of situations where high performance and precise control over memory and resources needed, such as:

* games
* real-time system
* High performance financial application (hi-freq trading)
* Graphical apps and sims
* Productivity apps
* Embedded software
* Audio and Video processing
* AI and neural network
